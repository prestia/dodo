dodo
=======

A cool template for [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto) with a terrible README.

Dodo is based on HTML5 Boilerplate v2, so it should play nicely with all browsers. Other improvements include optional twitter integration, SEO-friendly page titles and descriptions, Google Analytics support, jQuery support, highlight.js support, and lots more!

I could seriously use some help with minor tweaks and documentation. Feel free to hack away!
